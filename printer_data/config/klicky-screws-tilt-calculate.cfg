# This macro was provided by discord user Garrettwp to whom i give my thanks for sharing it with me.
# I have tweaked it a lot.
#
# this macro is  based on the great Annex magprobe dockable probe macros "#Originally developed by Mental, modified for better use on K-series printers by RyanG and Trails"
# that macro as since evolved into a klipper plugin that currently is pending inclusion in klipper
# more information here https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Quickdraw_Probe/tree/main/Klipper_Macros
#
# by standing on the shoulders of giants, lets see if we can see further
# User richardjm revised the macro variables and added some functions, thanks a lot

[screws_tilt_adjust]
#screw1:
#   The (X, Y) coordinate of the first bed leveling screw. This is a
#   position to command the nozzle to so that the probe is directly
#   above the bed screw (or as close as possible while still being
#   above the bed). This is the base screw used in calculations. This
#   parameter must be provided.
#screw1_name:
#   An arbitrary name for the given screw. This name is displayed when
#   the helper script runs. The default is to use a name based upon
#   the screw XY location.
#screw2:
#screw2_name:
#...
#   Additional bed leveling screws. At least two screws must be
#   defined.
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#screw_thread: CW-M3
#   The type of screw used for bed leveling, M3, M4, or M5, and the
#   rotation direction of the knob that is used to level the bed.
#   Accepted values: CW-M3, CCW-M3, CW-M4, CCW-M4, CW-M5, CCW-M5.
#   Default value is CW-M3 which most printers use. A clockwise
#   rotation of the knob decreases the gap between the nozzle and the
#   bed. Conversely, a counter-clockwise rotation increases the gap.
